File Structure
package.json = contains dependencies and dev dependencies ( libraries or modules that are required for your angular application to work.
main.ts = entry point to angular application.
app.module.ts = root module of application.
app.component.ts = root component of application.


ng serve working
Command to to start application.
when we run this command execution goes to main.ts file.
In main.ts we boostrap or kickstart AppModule.
In app.module.ts we bootstrap or kickstart AppComponent.
In app.component.ts file we have html template(app.component.html) and class inside app.component.ts that contains logic or data for the view.
In class we have property title = "Appname"
In html we have {{ title }} which in runtime gets replaced by Appname.
